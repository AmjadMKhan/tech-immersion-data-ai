# Day 1, Experience 1 - Handling Big Data with SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters

Contoso Auto stores data in several data stores, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and unstructured data stored in a data lake. They have heard of data virtualization in SQL Server 2019, and are interested to see whether this feature will allow them to more easily access their data stored in these disparate locations. They have heard of the new Big Data Clusters that can be scaled out to handle their Big Data workloads, including machine learning tasks and advanced analytics. They are also interested in any performance improvements against their internal SQL tables by moving to 2019, since the overall amount of data is growing at a rapid pace.

This experience will highlight the new features of SQL Server 2019 with a focus on Big Data Clusters and data virtualization. You will gain hands-on experience with querying both structured and unstructured data in a unified way using T-SQL. This capability will be illustrated by joining different data sets, such as telemetry data in flat CSV files in Azure Storage, CRM data stored in Oracle, parts data in Mongo DB, and transactional data in SQL Server for exploratory data analysis within Azure Data Studio. This joined data will be prepared into a table used for reporting, highlighting query performance against this table due to intelligent query processing. You will also learn how Docker containers are used to scale-out storage and compute to handle heavy workloads. With the inclusion of Apache Spark packaged with Big Data Clusters, it is now possible to use Spark to train machine learning models over data lakes and use those models in SQL Server in one system. You will learn how to use Azure Data Studio to work with Jupyter notebooks to train a simple model that can predict vehicle battery lifetime, then operationalize it within a stored procedure. Finally, you will experience the data security and compliance features provided by SQL Server 2019 by using the Data Discovery & Classification tool in SSMS to identify tables and columns with PII and GDPR-related compliance issues, then address the issues by layering on dynamic data masking to identified columns.

## Before the lab: Connecting to SQL Server 2019

Follow the steps below to connect to your SQL Server 2019 cluster with both Azure Data Studio and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

### Connect with Azure Data Studio

1.  On the bottom-left corner of your Windows desktop, locate the search box next to the Start Menu. Type **Azure Data Studio**, then select the Azure Data Studio desktop app in the search results.

    ![The search box has "Azure Data Studio" entered into it and the desktop app is highlighted in the results.](media/launch-azure-data-studio.png 'Launch Azure Data Studio')

2.  Within Azure Data Studio, select **Servers** from the top of the left-hand menu, then select **New Connection** from the top toolbar to the right of the menu.

    ![The Servers menu icon is selected, as well as the new connection icon.](media/ads-new-connection-link.png 'Azure Data Studio')

3.  Within the Connection dialog, configure the following:

    - **Connection type:** Select Microsoft SQL Server.
    - **Server:** Enter the IP address, followed by port number `31433`. For example: `123.123.123.123,31433`.
    - **Username:** Enter "sa".
    - **Password:** Enter the password provided to you for this lab.
    - **Remember password:** Checked.
    - Leave all other options at their default values.

    ![The Connection form is filled out with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields.](media/ads-new-connection.png 'Azure Data Studio - New Connection')

4.  Click **Connect**.

### Connect with SQL Server Management Studio

1.  On the bottom-left corner of your Windows desktop, locate the search box next to the Start Menu. Type **SQL Server Management Studio**, then select the SQL Server Management Studio desktop app in the search results.

    ![The search box has "SQL Server Management Studio" entered into it and the desktop app is highlighted in the results.](media/launch-ssms.png 'Launch SQL Server Management Studio')

2.  Within the Connection dialog that appears, configure the following:

    - **Server name:** Enter the IP address, followed by port number `31433`. For example: `123.123.123.123,31433`.
    - **Login:** Enter "sa".
    - **Password:** Enter the password provided to you for this lab.
    - **Remember password:** Checked.

    ![The Connect form is filled out with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields.](media/ssms-connection.png 'SQL Server Management Studio - Connect')

3.  Click **Options >>**.

4.  Select the **Additional Connection Parameters** tab. In the text area below, enter `TrustServerCertificate=True`. This is needed because the server certificates are dynamically generated for the Big Data Clusters, and are self-signed.

    ![The Additional Connection Parameters tab is selected and the TrustServerCertificate=True value is highlighted.](media/ssms-connection-additional.png 'Additional Connection Parameters')

5.  Click **Connect**.
