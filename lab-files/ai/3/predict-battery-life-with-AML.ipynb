This is a very powerful feature of Auto ML as it tries many best practices approaches for you, and saves you a lot of time and effort in the process.\n\nThe goal of Auto ML in this case is to find the best models that result, as measure by the normalized root mean squared error metric (as indicated by the `primary_metric` attribute). The error is basically a measure of what the model predicts versus what was provided as the \"answer\" in the training data.
