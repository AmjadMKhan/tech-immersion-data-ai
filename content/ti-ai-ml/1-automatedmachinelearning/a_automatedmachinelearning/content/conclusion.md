## Wrap-up

Congratulations on completing the Auto ML experience. In this experience you completed an end-to-end process for training a model and deploying the model into production, all from within a Jupyter Notebook hosted in Microsoft Azure Notebooks.  

To recap, you experienced:

1. How to use Azure Machine Learning Auto ML to simplify the processs of getting to a performant model.
2. Using Auto ML to train multiple models locally as well by using remote capabilities provided by compute targets.
3. Capturing and querying the telemetry of training runs using an Experiment.
4. Retrieving the best model created from an Auto ML session.
5. Registering the best model with the Model Registry, which enables versioning and makes the model file available for deployment to a web service.
6. Creating and deploying a web service to Azure Kubernetes Service that uses the best model for scoring.
