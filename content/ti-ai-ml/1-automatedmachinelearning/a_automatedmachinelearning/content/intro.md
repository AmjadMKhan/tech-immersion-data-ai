# Day 2, Experience 1 - Better models made easy with Automated Machine Learning

## Technology overview

Azure Machine Learning service provides a cloud-based environment you can use to prep data, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models.

Azure Machine Learning service fully supports open-source technologies. So you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages with machine learning components. Examples are PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. Support for rich tools makes it easy to interactively explore and prepare data and then develop and test models. Examples are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) or the [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/itemName/ms-toolsai.vscode-ai/overview) extension.

By using Azure Machine Learning service, you can start training on your local machine and then scale out to the cloud. With many available [compute targets](https://docs.microsoft.com%/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets), like Azure Machine Learning Compute and [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks), and with [advanced hyperparameter tuning services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters), you can build better models faster by using the power of the cloud. When you have the right model, you can easily deploy it in a container such as Docker. So it's simple to deploy to Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service. Or you can use the container in your own deployments, either on-premises or in the cloud. For more information, see the article on [how to deploy and where](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where).

You can manage the deployed models and track multiple runs as you experiment to find the best solution. After it's deployed, your model can return predictions in [real time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-consume-web-service) or [asynchronously](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-run-batch-predictions) on large quantities of data. And with advanced [machine learning pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-ml-pipelines), you can collaborate on all the steps of data preparation, model training and evaluation, and deployment.

Azure Machine Learning service also includes features that [automate model generation and tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-auto-train-models) to help you create models with ease, efficiency, and accuracy. Automated machine learning is the process of taking training data with a defined target feature, and iterating through combinations of algorithms and feature selections to automatically select the best model for your data based on the training scores. The traditional machine learning model development process is highly resource-intensive, and requires significant domain knowledge and time investment to run and compare the results of dozens of models. Automated machine learning simplifies this process by generating models tuned from the goals and constraints you defined for your experiment, such as the time for the experiment to run or which models to blacklist.

## Scenario overview

In this experience you will learn how the automated machine learning capability in Azure Machine Learning (AML) can be used for the life cycle management of the manufactured vehicles and how AML helps in creation of better vehicle maintenance plans. To accomplish this, you will train a Linear Regression model to predict the number of days until battery failure using Automated Machine Learning in Jupyter Notebooks.
