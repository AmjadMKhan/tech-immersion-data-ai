## Task 1: Train and deploy a deep learning model 

In this task, you will train a deep learning model to classify the descriptions of car components provided by technicians as compliant or non-compliant, convert it to ONNX, and deploy it as a web service. To accomplish this, you will use an Azure Databricks notebook to explore the transaction and account data.

1. From the Azure Portal, navigate to your deployed Azure Databricks workspace and select **Launch Workspace**.
