# Day 2, Experience 3 - Quickly build comprehensive Bot solutions with the Virtual Assistant Solution Accelerator

Contoso Auto is interested in building bots to help automate certain tasks in a way that feels similar to dealing with a real person. The motivation for this is to add self-service capabilities in their automobiles that will help drivers and passengers interact with their vehicles in a more natural way, through voice-driven commands and simple visual feedback and prompts, without needing to involve a live person. They would like to build a proof of concept that will support their users through speech actions, such as controlling the vehicle's climate settings and radio. As a stretch goal, they would like to take this capability further by automatically monitoring car sensor data and alerting the driver when there is a potential problem with the vehicle, offering an incentive such as a gift card when the driver selects a recommended service and makes an appointment with a service center.

In this experience, you will use Microsoft's [Virtual Assistant Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-virtual-assistant-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) accelerator to quickly develop this capability on top of foundational capabilities. By following the tasks below, you will explore and run the Automotive skill bot locally to experience the natural language-driven conversations with the bot, powered by the LUIS Cognitive Service, with the conversation control flow managed by the bot. You will end off by evaluating how LUIS is trained to understand a user's intent based on what they typed in, and read some ideas of how this project can be expanded to meet Contoso Auto's stretch goals.
