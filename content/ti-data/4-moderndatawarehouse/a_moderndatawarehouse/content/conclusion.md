## Wrap-up

In this experience, ​​you used Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW)  together to build a modern data warehouse.

You started by using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to automate the movement of data in various formats gathered from various sources, including Cosmos DB, into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). You then used Azure Databricks to prepare, analyze and visualize those data. Next, you used Spark Structured Streaming, in connection with the Azure Cosmos DB Spark Connector, to query streaming data from the Cosmos DB Change Feed, demonstrating how you can easily include near real-time data in your queries and aggregations in Databricks. You wrote aggregations of both static and streaming data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW).

You ended the modern data warehouse experience by using Power BI Desktop to connect to your SQL DW, and building a dashboard to provide visualizations of vehicle telemetry data.
