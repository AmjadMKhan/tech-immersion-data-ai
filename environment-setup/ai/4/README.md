# Creating repeatable processes with Azure Machine Learning pipelines

Complete the steps below to prepare the environment for the [AI, Experience 4](../../../ai-exp4/README.md) lab.

## Pre-requisites

- General: The experience runs within an Azure Machine Learning (AML) Notebook VM and uses an AML compute cluster.
- Attendees will want ready access to their: subscription ID and resource group name.
- Need pre-created resource group (e.g. `tech-immersion-XXXXX`) and machine learning workspace (e.g. `tech-immersion-aml-XXXXX`).
- Need pre-created AML training cluster named `aml-compute-cpu`, with two `STANDARD_DS2_V2` nodes.
