## Pre-requisites

  - General: The experience runs within the free tier of Azure Notebooks and uses a cluster created within Azure by using Azure Machine Learning.
  - Need pre-created resource group tech-immersion-onnx-xxxxx and machine learning workspace gpu-tech-immersion-aml-xxxxx
  - The AML cluster is created within the notebook, which requires a GPU enabled cluster (1 node, Standard_NC12)  
  - An ACI instance is created within the notebook, which requires cpu_cores=1, and memory_gb=1
